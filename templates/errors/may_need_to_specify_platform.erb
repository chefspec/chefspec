It appears that Chef could not find the resource on the given platform. As of
Chef 12.4, Chef conditionally loads resources based on the operating system
being provisioned. Double-check the error below and ensure you did not make any
typographical errors, and then continue reading.

The default operating system for ChefSpec is "chefspec", which means Chef will
not load many resources by default. For example, "dpkg_package" is not a
resource that is available on the "chefspec" operating system just like
"freebsd_package" is not available on the Windows operating system. As such,
you may get a Chef::Exceptions::NoSuchResourceType when using ChefSpec's default
options.

You can specify the platform and version you would like ChefSpec to act like
by specifying the platform and version like so:

    ChefSpec::SoloRunner.new(platform: 'ubuntu', version: '16.04')

You can read more information in ChefSpec's README or the Fauxhai project:
