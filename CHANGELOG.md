## 9.3.3 (Feb 22, 2022)

- Fix a failure running chefspec with Policyfiles

## 9.3.2 (Feb 21, 2022)

- Remove a hack in the Hash class that worked around issues in Windows previously
- Fix ChefSpec does not automatically install cookbooks from chef server when using Policyfile.rb
- Remove Travis CI config

## 9.3.1 (Aug 23, 2021)

- Resolved an error that could cause failures with some resources

## 9.3.0 (May 4, 2021)

- Add support for resources that include a `description` value in the action
- Require Ruby 2.5+ and Chef Infra Client 15+
- Add support for Ruby 3

## 9.2.1 (August 13, 2020)

- Improve performance by only requiring external libraries if they are not already loaded
- Expand testing to additional releases of Chef Infra Client

## 9.2.0 (June 10, 2020)

- Updated `stubs_for_resource` stubbing for the new `after_resource` state in Chef Infra Client 16.
- Added support for Ohai segments in cookbooks
- Resolved warnings when running on Ruby 2.7+

## 9.1.0 (February 12, 2020)

- Added a new `include_any_recipe` matcher which allows you to write ChefSpecs that ensure a cookbook does not include recipes. Thanks @jasonwbarnett
- Fixed stubbing of Chef::Provider when using Poise's resource_provider_mixin. Thanks @Annih
- Switched require statements to require_relative to speed up requiring libraries in ChefSpec

## 9.0.0 (October 8, 2019)

- The fauxhai dependency has been switched to the fauxhai-ng. Fauxhai-ng is the original source of the fauxhai project in the chefspec GitHub org, but with a new name. This is considered a major update as it forces users to upgrade to use fauxhai-ng >= 7.5 where as the previous ChefSpec release allowed for fauxhai >= 6.11.

## 8.0.1 (September 30, 2019)

- Added back the ChefSpec report templates until the time that we fully remove the report feature.

## 8.0.0 (July 16, 2019)

- ChefSpec now requires Ruby 2.4+ and Chef 14+. Keep in mind that you can still test cookbooks designed for older versions of Chef Infra Client, but you'll need a somewhat modern chef gem to run ChefSpec.
- ChefSpec now depends on the new chef-cli gem, which provides Chef Policyfiles functionality. This means you can now use ChefSpec to test Policyfiles without needing to run those tests from within ChefDK or Chef Workstation. Gem install chefspec!

## 7.4.0 (June 27, 2019)

- Require Ruby 2.3+, Chef 13+, and Fauxhai 6.11+
- The majority of examples have been updated for the new ChefSpec 7.3+ format
- Properly loaded mixlib/shellout before trying to stub commands to prevent some failures
- Added a new `policyfile_path` configuration option for specifying the path to the PolicyFile

## 7.3.4 (December 26, 2018)

- Add back the spec files to the gem package for testing within Chef-DK

## 7.3.3 (December 10, 2018)

- Slimmed the size of the gem install down by not shipping test / development or example files in the gem artifact. These will remain in the repo for reference and testing.
- Updated the homepage in the Gemspec to be the Github repo
- Improved the stubbing documentation in the readme

## 7.3.2 (September 14, 2018)

- Improve runner construction code
- Make options to receive_shell_out work a bit better.

## 7.3.1 (September 1, 2018)

- Add additional hooks for customizing the runner creation process.

## 7.3.0 (August 30, 2018)

- Major syntax overhaul and update. Check out the [README](/README.md) for examples of the updated syntax. The older syntax is still present and will be supported at least until ChefSpec 8.0, but documentation has been moved to [README_old](/README_old.md).

## 7.2.1 (May, 8, 2018)

- Updated an example and test for that example

## 7.2.0 (April, 10, 2018)

- The fauxhai dependency is no longer constrained. This removes the need to release a new version of Chefspec each time a major release of Fauxhai is released. Previously Fauxhai was constraine to < 6\. The current release is 6.1.0, which includes significant new platform data and dumps that are updated for Chef 14.

## 7.1.2 (March, 6, 2018)

This release deprecated the spec coverage feature, which will be removed in a future release. In general this feature leads to users writing unnecessary and generally useless specs in an attempt to reach 100% spec coverage. ChefSpec is useful for testing the parts of your cookbook that include logic, but if a particular resource has no logic behind it, then there's little value in testing. We shouldn't provide a mechanism that encourages writing unnecessary specs that give a false assurance test coverage.

## 7.1.1 (November 28, 2017)

- Better support for matching action :nothing in resources

## 7.1.0 (May 9, 2017)

- Resource matchers are now generated automatically. What does this mean for you? A lot:

  1. You won't have to worry about older releases of ChefSpec not knowing about new resources in chef-client.
  2. You won't have to define the matchers in your cookbook code, which also means you won't have issues if a community cookbook lacks matchers

- Removed the usage of Cucumber for testing

- Removed all test deps from the Gemspec

- Added a warning about stubbing core Ruby methods and the issues that can cause

## 7.0.0 (April 18, 2017)

- Increased the chef gem dependency from 12.6+ to 12.14+. Since ChefSpec is consumed within ChefDK this actually has a minor impact on end users who generally consume Chefspec via ChefDK, which will bundle both compatible chef and chefspec releases.
- Fixed incompatibilities with Chef 13.
- Loosened the Fauxhai dependency to allow for the upcoming Fauxhai 5.0 release.
- Removed easy_install_package testing and examples as easy_install_package was removed in Chef 13\. The actual matcher is still present for users with existing specs against Chef 12 cookbooks.
- Added additional testing and an example for LWRPs with use_inline_resources defined.
- Added testing against Chef 13 and Ruby 2.4.
- Removed code that supported Chef < 12.5.

## 6.2.0 (March 27, 2017)

- Correctly handle the block form of search() when using stubs
- Add support for alternative reporting output from Coverage.report!

## 6.1.0 (March 9, 2017)

- Loosen the Fauxhai dependency to allow Fauxhai 4.0 This deprecates a large number of Ohai mocks for end of life platforms. See <https://github.com/chefspec/fauxhai/blob/master/PLATFORMS.md> for the current list of platforms supported by Fauxhai
- SoloRunner defaults to use_policyfile == false now

## 6.0.1 (February 24, 2017)

- Add the ability to set the Chef Zero port range used by the ServerRunner

## 6.0.0 (February 22, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES

## 4.1.0 (October 12, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

- Bump the minimum required version of Chef to 11.14
- Filter resources that have no source line in the coverage report - this is related to a bug in Chef where, when cloning a resource, both the clone and the original resource lose their metadata

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Allow multiple instances of a Chef Server instance
- Separate ChefSpec::Runner into `ChefSpec::SoloRunner` and `ChefSpec::ServerRunner`
- Preliminary support for Chef 12 alpha (not 100% complete)
- Add `SoloRunner` and `ServerRunner` `.converge` methods for quickly converging if you do not need to customize the runner object

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Due to the new `ServerRunner`, the `ChefSpec::Server` singleton object has been deprecated. As much as I would like to provide a backwards-compatible interface, there is no way to do so (as the code now supports multiple Chef Server instances). Sorry :(.
- Remove old deprecations - this is not really a breaking change, but the v2.0.0 deprecations have been removed in favor of new ones

## 3.0.0 (October 20, 2013)

Breaking:

- Dropped support for Chef 9 & 10
- Renamed `ChefSpec::ChefRunner` to `ChefSpec::Runner` to better reflect what happens in Chef Core. Using `ChefRunner` will throw deprecation errors for now and will be removed in a future release.
- Removed MiniTest Chef Handler examples/matchers
- No longer load default cookbook paths:

  - vendor/cookbooks
  - test/cookbooks
  - test/integration (test kitchen)
  - spec/cookbooks

- Resource matchers all follow the pattern "(action)_(resource_name)". ChefSpec will warn you of these deprecations in 3.0\. They will be removed in 4.0\. However, some resources cannot be automatically converted - **these resources will raise a deprecation exception of `ChefSpec::NoConversionError`**. The following matchers have changed:

  - `execute_command` => `run_execute`
  - `set_service_to_start_on_boot` => `enable_service`
  - `create_file_with_content` => `render_file`
  - `execute_(script)` => `run_(script)`
  - `execute_ruby_block` => `run_ruby_block`
  - `install_package_at_version` => `install_package().with(version: '')`
  - `*_python_pip` => (removed - see "Packaging Custom LWRPs in the README")

- Remove dependency on Erubis

- Remove dependency on MiniTest Chef Handler

- Remove development dependency on Cucumber

- Remove development dependency on i18n

- Remove development dependency on simplecov

- Separate package matchers. In prior versions of ChefSpec, the `package` matcher would match on any kind of package and any kind of package action. However, some subclasses of the package resource do not support all actions. Each package provider now has it's own matcher with only the actions it supports. Prior specs that used the generic `package` matcher will no longer match on subclasses - you must use the specific subclass matcher.

- Separate file/cookbook_file/template matchers. In prior versions of ChefSpec, the `file` matcher would match on `file`, `cookbook_file`, and `template`. This is not ideal because it doesn't verify the correct message was sent. Now, `file`, `cookbook_file`, and `template` matchers will _only_ match resources of that type. For generic file checking, please use the new `render_file` matcher.

- Guards are now evaluated by default. If a shell guard is executed, it must first be stubbed with the `stub_command` macro.

- `Runner#resources` converted from an Array to a Hash. This is to ensure that all resource actions are added (when multiple calls to run_action exist (#201)). This also drastically improves resource lookup times.

- `Resource#actions` is no longer maniuplated. Instead, a new method `Resource#performed_actions` now keeps track of the actions taken on a resource (as well as the phase in which they were taken), preserving the original state of the resource.

FEATURES:

- Added a new `render_file` action to replace `create_file_with_content`. This matcher will render the contents of any file to a string and then optionally compare the result if given a `with` chainable.
- All resources now accept a `with` chainable for matching specific resource attributes.
- Windows attributes are now testable on non-Windows systems (like `inherits`)
- Added `batch` resource matchers
- Added `cookbook_file` resource matchers
- Added `deploy` resource matchers
- Added `erl_call` resource matchers
- Added `git` resource matchers
- Added `http_request` resource matchers
- Added `ifconfig` resource matchers
- Normalized `link` resource matchers
- Added `log` resource matchers
- Added `mdadm` resource matchers
- Added `mount` resource matchers
- Added `:immediate` and `:delayed` notification matchers
- Added `ohai` resource matchers
- Added `powershell_script` matchers (Chef 11.6+)
- Added `registry_key` matchers
- Added `remote_directory` matchers
- Added `route` matchers
- Added `subversion` matchers
- Added `stub_command` macro (formerly on `ChefSpec::ChefRunner`) for stubbbing the results of shell commands. Because shell commands are evaluated by default, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a shell command that has not been stubbed.
- Added `stub_search` macro for easily stubbing `search` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `search` call that has not been stubbed.
- Added `stub_data_bag` macro for easily stubbing `data_bag` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `data_bag` call that has not been stubbed.
- Added `stub_data_bag_item` macro for easily stubbing`data_bag_item` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `data_bag_item` call that has not been stubbed.
- Added `stub_node` helper for quickly generating a node object from Fauxhai data
- Added `ChefSpec::Runner#apply` command to mimic the behavior of `chef-apply` (use with caution)
- Share the `ChefSpec::Runner` object with the Node object
- Add `chefspec/berkshelf` for easily integrating specs with Berkshelf (2 & 3)
- Add `.at_compile_time` and `.at_converge_time` matchers for asserting which phase of the Chef run a resource should be run

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Move to inline documentation (Yard)
- Implement InProcess Aruba testing for ultra-fast tests
- Create "examples" directory for testing and demonstration
- Unified all failure_messages_for_should
- Use `shared_examples` for easily testing defined custom matchers
- Infer the `cookbook_path` from the calling spec
- Directly set node attributes with Fauxhai (formerly this was an O(n) operation)
- Refactored ExpectExpectation to work without stubbing
- Use Chef's `resource_collection` to identify resources instead of our own custom proxy
